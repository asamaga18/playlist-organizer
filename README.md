# ðŸŽµ Playlist Organizer

A personal web app to help you organize your Spotify playlists, one song at a time.

## What is this?

This is a project I built for myself to make it easier to move songs between my Spotify playlists. It lets you pick a playlist, review each song, and quickly add it to any of your other playlists, all in a clean, modern interface.

## Features

- **Spotify Login**: Securely log in with your Spotify account.
- **Pick a Source Playlist**: Choose any of your playlists to organize.
- **Song-by-Song Review**: Go through each song and decide which other playlists to add it to.
- **Curate Target Playlists**: (Optional) For each source playlist, you can choose which playlists show up as targets, so you only see the ones you care about.
- **Search & Sort Playlists**: Quickly find the right playlist when adding songs.
- **Start Anywhere**: Start organizing from any song number or search for a song to begin from.
- **Responsive, Dark UI**: Looks great on desktop and mobile, with album art, emoji, and smooth controls.
- **Listen on Spotify**: Open any song directly in Spotify with one click.

## How it works
