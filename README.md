# ðŸŽµ Playlist Organizer

A modern web app for organizing your Spotify playlists, one song at a time.

## Features

- **Spotify Authentication**: Securely log in with your Spotify account using the official API and PKCE flow.
- **Source Playlist Selection**: Choose any of your playlists as the "source" to organize.
- **Song-by-Song Review**: Go through each song in your source playlist and decide which other playlists to add it to.
- **Curated Target Playlists (per source)**: Curate which playlists appear as targets for each source playlist, so you only see the ones you care about for that session.
- **Playlist Search & Sorting**: Quickly search and sort your playlists when selecting targets.
- **Hotkeys Sidebar**: (Optional) Save your favorite playlists as "hotkeys" for quick access and one-click adding.
- **Back Button**: Go back to the previous song and change your decision if you make a mistake.
- **Start From Any Song**: Start organizing from any song number or search for a song to begin from.
- **Responsive, Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with playlist covers, emoji, and smooth controls.

    - Select which playlists to add it to
    - Use hotkeys for quick adding (if enabled)
    - Skip, go back, or add to playlists
5. **Finish** when all songs are reviewed!
